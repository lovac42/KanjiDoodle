## Kanji Doodle: For drawing and writing

### About:
Touch screen functionality for Anki. Featured changes include changing colors, changing pen size, and saving. It will only save the drawings and not the background images. If you want everything saved, then just take a screenshot.


### Addon Conflict:
Works with NightMode, but this addon must be loaded first before NightMode loads. This is a problem with NM.


### Credits:
This is my own OOP version rewritten based on TouchScreen v0.2.6 by krassowski https://github.com/krassowski/Anki-TouchScreen
