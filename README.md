## TouchScreenEvo: For drawing and writing

### About:
Touch screen functionality for Anki


### Addon Conflict:
Works with NightMode, but this addon must be loaded first before NightMode loads. This is a problem with NM.


### Credits:
This is my own OOP version rewritten based on TouchScreen v0.2.6 by krassowski https://github.com/krassowski/Anki-TouchScreen
