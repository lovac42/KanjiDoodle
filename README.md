## TouchScreenEvo: For drawing and writing

### About:
Touch screen functionality for Anki

Implements same drawing/writing mechanism as in AnkiDroid. Your writing is NOT intended to remain on the cards after review - same as in AnkiDroid.

Use the menu `View` â†’ `TouchScreen` to activate/change settings.

Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to toggle the touchscreen. (Customizable)

Use icons which will show up in the top right corner of the review screen to temporarily hide/clean the board.
Enjoy!


### Addon Conflict:
Works with NightMode, but this addon must be loaded first before NightMode loads.

### Credits:
This is my own rewritten OOP version based on TouchScreen v0.2.6 by krassowski https://github.com/krassowski/Anki-TouchScreen
