## Kanji Doodle: For drawing and writing

### About:
Touch screen functionality for Anki. Featured changes include changing colors, changing pen size, and saving. It will only save the drawings and not the background images. If you want everything saved, then just take a screenshot.


### Addon Conflict:
Works with NightMode, but this addon must be loaded first before NightMode loads. This is a problem with NM. The original code uses a hacky trick to get around this issue, but I found that it often causes freezing and avoided using it. Ensuring that NM loads last is by renaming NM with a z prefix is enough to avoid this conflict.


### Saving:
To save, click on save, select the desired crop area, then click on the red highlighted save button again. A dialog will open asking you which field to append the new image to.
